## Background

This repository contains a phase-field model for solid-state transformations in Inconel 625 based on
[Zhou *et al.*](#zhou-2014), which is a ternary generalization of the binary [KKS model](#kim-1999).

To capture δ, μ, and Laves precipitates in a γ matrix, I have chosen Ni–30%Cr–2%Nb as the model
system. The interdendritic regions in additive manufacturing get enriched to Ni–31%Cr–13%Nb.  The
four-phase three-component model is represented using two composition fields (Cr and Nb) and three
phase fields (δ, μ, and Laves). There is one dependent composition (Ni) and one dependent phase (γ).

Free energies for each constituent phase are computed using a CALPHAD database, simplified from [Du
*et al.*](#du-2005) to enable one-to-one mapping of sublattice compositions to system
compositions. This database is provided in [Du_Cr-Nb-Ni_simple.tdb](Du_Cr-Nb-Ni_simple.tdb). The
CALPHAD expressions are further simplified using 2<sup>nd</sup>-order Taylor series (paraboloid)
approximations.

## Install

This repository contains Python code to handle the CALPHAD database and C++ code to perform the
phase-field simulation. A Python 3 interpreter and C++11 compiler are recommended. You will need to
satisfy the following dependencies:

- Python
  - [PyCALPHAD](http://pycalphad.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
  - [SymPy](http://www.sympy.org/en/index.html)

- C++
  - [MMSP](https://github.com/mesoscale/mmsp)
  
After downloading MMSP, the core dependency of this model implementation, please set the
environmental variable ```MMSP_PATH``` to its location. If you are using ```bash```, do something
similar to

```
  echo "MMSP_PATH=~/Downloads/mmsp" >> ~/.bashrc
  . ~/.bashrc
```

You will also want to build the MMSP utilities, as described in the MMSP documentation.

## Usage

1. ```python CALPHAD_energies.py``` This will use pycalphad to read the database and extract
   expressions, which are then manipulated and written into C-code by SymPy.
2. ```make``` (OpenMP, Intel compiler).  This will compile the source code into a binary,
   ```alloy625```.
   - or ```make serial``` (serial, GNU compiler).  This will compile the source code into a binary,
     ```serial```.
   - or ```make parallel``` (MPI, GNU compiler).  This will compile the source code into a binary,
     ```parallel```.
3. Run the code. Since your executable is built against ```MMSP.main.hpp```, the options of that
   program apply to your binary. For usage suggestions, run ```./alloy625 --help``` or ```./serial
   --help``` or ```mpirun -np 1 parallel --help```, depending on which executable you built.  A
   typical MMSP run comprises two steps: initialization and update loops.  So you would normally do:
   - ```./alloy625 --example 2 data.dat```
   - ```./alloy625 data.dat 10000000 1000000```
   - ```mmsp2pvd data.dat data.*.dat``` to generate VTK visualization files,
     then use a VTK viewer such as ParaView or Mayavi to see the results.
4. Remix, run, and analyze your own variants.
